# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description
This is a simple *Rock, Paper, Scissors* game built using Javascript. It is the third project in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) *Foundations* course. The project spec page can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). Currently, the game is played entirely in the browser console, however a GUI will be added in a future project.
